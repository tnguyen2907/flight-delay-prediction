## Next.js Web Application with Tailwind CSS

![NextJS Web Application](../assets/web_app.png)

The web application consists of three main tabs:
- **Home Page**

- **Dashboard**: Embeds a Looker Studio dashboard that visualizes key trends and statistics on flight delays, airlines, airports, and weather factors, powered by BigQuery.

- **Prediction Page**: Allows users to enter flight details and receive real-time delay predictions using a model served through **Databricks Model Serving** via REST API.


## Flight Delay Prediction Workflow

1. **Form Initialization**  
   Airline and airport options are dynamically loaded from **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** and cached using Next.jsâ€™ `unstable_cache` to reduce latency and avoid redundant fetches.

2. **Input Validation & Feature Transformation**  
   Upon submission, flight inputs are validated (e.g., valid IATA codes, chronological timestamps). Additional features are derived (e.g., quarter, day of week, elapsed flight time) to match model input requirements.

3. **Fetch Weather Data**  
   The app calls **OpenWeatherMap** to retrieve real-time weather data for the origin and destination airports at the scheduled times.

4. **Model Inference via Databricks**  
   The final feature set is sent as a JSON payload to **Databricks Model Serving**. The model returns if the flight is likely to be delayed or not.

### Performance & Reliability Optimizations

- **Caching**  
  Prediction responses and weather data are cached to minimize redundant API calls and improve responsiveness.
  
- **Rate Limiting**  
  A daily request limit is enforced server-side to control API costs
